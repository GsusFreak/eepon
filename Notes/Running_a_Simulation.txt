To Run a Simulation:

 - Make sure the latest version of eponsim is 
   compiled. 

 - Open the terminal.
   Navigate to \epon_sims\sim_mgr$
   (type cd epon_sims/sim_mgr).
   Run sim_mgr.py (type python sim_mgr.py).

1. Login (password is probably ONSmart).

2. Choose a Simulation ID using template
   MovieName_Quantization_TypeOfPrediction
   for example:
   BluePlanet_Q20_PerfAcc

    - Types of prediction include:
      Poff (no prediction was used)
      NAR (Collin's NAR system created the
         prediction values.)
      PerfAcc (The prediction values are
         perfectly accurate.)
      10Minus (The prediction values are
         10% smaller than the actual size
         of the next packet.)
      10Plus (The prediction values are
         10% larger than the actual size
         of the next packet.)

3. Video Traffic ==> ON

    - Pick Trace (Should be in the 
      *Home*\Video_Trace_Files directory).

4. SET UNCHANGING PARAMETERS:
   Data Traffic Type ==> Poisson
   Grant Scheduling ==> IPACT-PSF
   Grant Sizing (Data) ==> LIMITED
   Grant Sizing (Video) ==> LIMITED
   Frame Rate ==> 24.0 (Check trace)

5. Predict Video Traffic ==> ON/OFF (Add Label)

6. LAUNCH the simulation.

7. Check if Simulation started using top command.
   Stop process with: kill *ProcessID*



When Running Multiple Simulations Back to Back:

1. Change the Simulation ID.

2. Change the Trace.
