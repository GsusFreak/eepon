To Get Usable Data from Simulation
Results:

 - Designate a place to consolidate
   the results in.

1. Place all simlation result folders
   in the same directory along with
   Extract_Results.py.

2. Run Extract_Results.py:

   --> python Extract_Results.py






Antiquated:

For each simulation:

1. Copy the following files to the
   results folder:

      od_pn_vid_ ...
      vod_pn_vid_ ...
      vods_pn_vid_ ...

2. Embed a tag into the title of each
   file.

      od_pn_vid ------ _PerfAcc_ ...
   +
      _BP_Q_20
   =
      od_pn_vid_BP_Q_20_PerfAcc_ ...

 - Make sure you get the first
   od_pn_vid_ ...
   instead of the second one which
   has a _xl suffix.

 - The od_ ... file is near the middle,
   and the vod_ ... and vods_ ...
   files are very near the bottom and
   right next to each other.

 - od_ ... is data delay
   vod_ ... is video delay
   vods_ ... is video delay jitter
